    "   - Outdated comments can be more confusing than no comments at all. Update comments as you update your code.\n",

    "   - Don't write comments that just repeat what the code does, e.g., `x = x + 1  # Adding 1 to x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Inline Comments Sparingly**:\n",
    "   - These are comments inside a line of code. They can be useful, but overuse can make the code look cluttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Function/Method Comments**:\n",
    "   - Describe what the function/method does, its parameters, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Large Comment Blocks**:\n",
    "   - It's usually better to break up the code and comment each piece rather than having a large chunk of code followed by a large comment block.\n",
